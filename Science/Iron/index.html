<h3>About Iron</h3>
<p>Figure 1 shows the chemical structure of Iron. It’s atomic weight is 55.845
	and it’s electron configuration is [Ar]3<i>d</i><sup>6</sup>4<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>. (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/editor/The-Editors-of-Encyclopaedia-Britannica/4419">The Editors of Encyclopaedia
	Britannica</a>, last updated October 2019)</p>

<p>Minerals are present in the natural environment, they can be found on both the surface and underground. Ores are a form of rock, they contain minerals with metal elements (Dunee, last updated April 2012). The difference is that minerals are made up of chemicals whereas ores contain 2 or more minerals. Minerals are usually extracted by having the iron ore being first blasted and dug up from open pit mines. The ores are then transported to crushing and screening plants.
